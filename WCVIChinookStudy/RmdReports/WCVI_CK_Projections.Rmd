This report describes  projection-based limit reference points (LRPs) for the WCVI Chinook salmon Stock Management Unit (SMU) and describes the parameterization of the forward projection model. The SMU contains 3 Conservation Units (CUs), 7 inlets, and 20 indicators stocks (Table 1) <!--\@ref(tab:WCVICKOverview).-->.

Table: Table 1.<!--: (\#tab:WCVICKOverview)--> Overview of WCVI Chinook Stock Management Unit. Asterisk represents indicators with average PNI values > 0.5. Note, inlets, San Juan and Nitinat do not contain indicator stocks with PNI > 0.5, and are not included in these analyses.




Only indicator stocks that are not heavily enhanced were included when deriving inlet-level spawner abundances (average PNI>0.5), resulting in the inclusion 5 inlets covering all 3 WCVI CUs (Fig. 1). We only included years when all indicators with PNI>0.5 were monitored; missing values were not infilled. In future work, infilled time-series of indicators within inlets could be developed to extend the available time-series.

## Parameterization

Stock recruitment parameters were derived from a previously developed run-reconstruction for WCVI Chinook based on spawner abundances from indicator stocks, age compositions from natural indicators across wCVI, and exploitation on Robertson Creek fish (D. Dobson & D. McHugh, pers. comm., Table 1). 

Base-case parameters are provided in Table 2. Parameters were either estimated from a run reconstruction for WCVI Chinook developed previously by DFO (D. Dosbon and D. McHugh pers. comm.), estimated from the Watershed-Area model (Parken et al. 2006), or derived from a life-stage model with expert opinion (W. Luedke pers. comm.). Projections were run over 50,000 random MC trials to derive projection-based LRPs (and 10,000 for sensitivity analyses).

We chose covariance parameters so that the resulting projections of inlet-specific spawner abundances exhibited correlations among inlets that were similar to observed correlations among inlets (Fig. 2). Specifically, model parameters were adjusted so that resulting correlations among inlets in projected spawner abundances approximated observed correlations in spawner abundances.

Pairwise correlations between observed inlet-specific spawner time-series were relatively strong in the 1990s and early 2000s, and have become slightly weaker since 2015.  The correlations among inlets for running 20-year time periods are provided in Figure 2. Starting in 1993, the first boxplot displays the distribution of pair-wise correlations among 5 inlets for the time-period 1993-2013; the second box-plot displays correlations for 1994-2014, etc.. A decline in correlations in evident in the last two time periods. The final boxplot shows the correlation over the entire time-series.

Within the forward projection model, correlations in spawner abundances among inlets are driven by three model components each described in more detail below: (1) covariance in exploitation rates among inlets, which is determined from a common interannual exploitation (due to shared exploitation offshore, parameterized from pre-terminal exploitation on Robertson Creek hatchery fish), and additional inlet-specific variability in exploitation, (2) covariance in recruitment residuals among inlets, and (3) covariance in age proportions of recruits among inlets. 

### (1) Covariance in exploitation
We assumed an average exploitation rate as observed for WCVI Chinook in recent years (2010-2019, Robertson Creek indicator, 30%, Fig. 3), with common interannual variability in exploitation rates due to shared exploitation history offshore. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "**Figure 3**. Pre-terminal exploitation rates for Robertson Creek CWT indicator."}
ERs <- read.csv("DataIn/ER.csv")
g<- ggplot(ERs,aes(Year, ER)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
g
#ggsave(g, filename="ERs.png")
```

In forward projections, interannual variability in exploitation rates was assumed to be beta distributed (constrained between 0 and 1), parameterized from estimated pre-terminal exploitation rates for Robertson Creek, with a coefficient of variation (cv) = 0.17. Without data to parameterize inlet-specific variability in exploitation rates, we assumed the inlet-specific variability was half the common (SMU-level) interannual variability (cv=0.085), and varied this in sensitivity analyses from 0 and 0.17 to cover plausible bounds. Figure 4 shows the distribution of realized exploitation rates from the average exploitation rate of 0.3, for two levels of variability, cv = 0.17 and cv = 0.085 (the third level cv=0 represents no variability in exploitation among inlets).

An example time-series of interannual variability in exploitation rates that is common among inlets (blue line), and inlet-specific variability around that common trend (green lines) is is shown in Fig. 5. We assumed that inlets were either consistently under or over-harvested relative to the average over the entire time-series (e.g., due to the spatial and temporal variability in inlet-specific migration patterns affecting vulnerability to fisheries), but that this bias changed over MC trials. Future analyses could include consistent biases in exploitation for specific inlets (e.g., positive biases for southern inlets and negative biases for northern inlets).

In the forward projection model, pairwise correlations in projected spawner abundances among inlets were similar to observed pairwise correlations in spawner abundances among inlets (Fig. 5). Varying assumptions about variability in exploitation among inlets between cv= 0 and 0.17 did not impact the distribution of correlations in spawner abundances in the projections.

### (2) Covariance in recruitment residuals
We parameterized correlations in recruitment residuals among inlets from the correlations in spawner abundances among inlets (derived from WCVI Chinook run reconstruction, D. Dobson and D. McHugh, pers. comm. Fig. 6). In sensitivity analyses, we scaled the pairwise correlations in recruitment residuals among inlets by 0.5 and 0 of the observed spawner correlations (0 representing recruitment residuals that were uncorrelated among inlets in the projections).

When we assumed correlations in recruitment residuals equal to observed spawner correlations (i.e., scalar = 1) the resulting correlations in spawner abundances from the projections matched observed correlations (Fig. 7). Reducing the correlations in recruitment residuals (i.e., scaling by 0.5 or 0) resulted spawner correlations in the projections that were lower than those observed.

### (3) Variability in age proportions recruits among inlets

For the base case, we assumed that age proportions of recruits varied over time and among inlets parameterized from estimated age proportions of recruits (aligned by brood year) calculated for each CU (SWVI, Nookta & Kyuquot, and NWVI; D. Dobson pers. comm.; inlet-specific age-proportions were not available) (Fig. 8). Specifically, we used the CU-specific mean proportions at each age and annual deviations in those proportions based on a multivariate logistic distribution parameterized from the estimated time-series of age proportions.
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 8**. Time-series of proportions at age in recruitment aligned by brood year, calculated from run reconstruction for West Coast of Vancouver Island Chinook by CU."}
cuAges <- read.csv(paste(wcviCKDir, "/DataIn/CUages.csv", sep=""))
cuAges <- cuAges %>% pivot_longer(cols=c("age2", "age3", "age4", "age5"),
                                  names_to="Age", values_to="Proportion")

cuAges$CU_Names. <- factor(cuAges$CU_Names,
                            levels=c("Southwest_Vancouver_Island",
                                     "Nootka_Kyuquot",
                                     "Northwest_Vancouver_Island",
                                     "Westcoast_Vancouver_Island"))

g.ages <- cuAges %>% filter(CU_Names!="Westcoast_Vancouver_Island") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, Proportion, group=CU_Names., colour=CU_Names.)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~Age, ncol=1)
g.ages
#ggsave(g.ages, filename="Figures/agePpns.png")
# If required, consider adding geom_density of pairwise correlations in estimated age ppns of recruits

```


We ran a sensitivity analysis under an alternative assumption that age proportions varied over years but were constant among CUs. Under this alternative assumption, we found that pairwise correlations of spawner abundances in projections were much higher than those observed (Fig. 9), generating time-series that were unrealistic. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 9**. Distribution of correlations of spawner abundances among inlets for observed data over the most recent 20 years (n=10 pairwise correlations) and projected time-series under the assumptions of variable age proportions among CUs and constant proportions among CUs.

## LRPs
Projection-based LRPs were developed under the base-case assumptions of (1) interannual variability in exploitation rates among inlets with a cv = 0.085, (2) correlations in recruitment residuals among inlets equal to observed spawner correlations among inlets, and (3) variability in age proportions among CUs and years. We identified a provisional aggregate abundance LRP with p=0.5 (50% probability of all inlets being greater than their lower benchmark) equal to `r (read.csv(paste(wcviCKDir, "/DataOut/ProjectedLRPs/ProjectedLRPsbaseER_ALLp.csv", sep=""))%>% pull(LRP))[1]` (Fig. 10). Provisional LRPs at p=0.66 ("likely" that all inlets are above their lower benchmarks) is also provided (Fig. 10). Probabilities did not exceed 0.9 so LRPs at higher p values could not be estimated.
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 10**.

Probabilities of all inlets being above lower benchmarks did not exceed 90%, so LRPs at higher p-values (0.9 and 0.99) could not be evaluated. Each dot is the proportion of MC trials where all inlets were > lower benchmarks within a 200-fish bin of aggregate abundances. Note, LRPs at p = 0.66 require more MC trials for stabilization.", out.width = '60%'}

We considered sensitivity analyses on interannual variabilty in exploitation rates among inlets with cv = 0 and 0.17 (Fig. 11).

For the base case parameters, the candidate projection-based LRPs were compared against time-series of aggregate abundances observed for WCVI Chinook salmon (sum of indicator stocks with PNI > 0.5), showing that abundances are currently below these LRPs and have been near or below them over the available time-series.

```

## Sensitivity of projection-based LRPs to average exploitation rates
   
We then evaluated the sensitivity of projection-based LRPs to underlying average exploitation rates. LRPs tend to be lower under low exploitation and higher with high exploitation (Fig. 13). In projections with average exploitation >35%, high aggregate abundances are driven by one or a small number of dominant inlets, while low productivity inlets, such as Barkley Sound, remain below their lower benchmark in a high proportion of MC trials. At low exploitation rates, all inlets tend to be above their lower benchmarks at moderate to high aggregate abundances (with >80% probability).
   
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 13**. Projection-based LRPs estimated across a range of underlying average exploitation rates, from 5% to 45% in increments of 5%. LRPs at 2 probability values are highlighted, p=0.5  and p=0.66. At 40% and 45% exploitation, more MC trials are required for stabilization of LRPs",  out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(paste(wcviCKDir,"/Figures/ProjectedLRPs/ERs_ProjLRPCurve_ALLp.png",sep=""))

```
   
## Sensitivity of projection-based LRPs to productivity
   
As expected, projection-based LRPs tend to increase under low productivity and are lower under high productivity, highlighting the value of updating projection-based LRPs as productivity changes. Uncertainty in projections increases under low productivity, requiring more random MC trials for stabilization at p=0.5 (> 10,000). The probability of all inlets being above their lower benchmark rarely met or exceeded 0.66 when productivity was low, so LRPs at this level could not be estimated. When productivity was high, the probability of all inlets being above their lower benchmark rarely dropped below 0.66. LRPs at the p=0.5 level could not be estimated with n=10,000 trials, though may be possible with more MC trials.
   
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 14**. Projection-based LRPs estimated under assumptions of reduced producitivty (0.75x of current levels) and increased productivity (1.5x current levels). More MC trials are required for stabilization of LRPs at lower productivity"}
